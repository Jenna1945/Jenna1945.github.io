    <p class="paragraph"> Moreno was born in Sacramento, California, the second of five children. His mother is of Mexican 
        and Chinese descent and his father is Mexican. The nickname "Chino" is the Spanish-language term for Chinese people.  
        He grew up in the Oak Park area and attended McClatchy High School, where he met Abe Cunningham and Stephen Carpenter, 
        with whom he founded Deftones in 1988. Before becoming a professional musician, Moreno had a day job at Tower Records' 
        shipping department.  Moreno currently resides in Lake Oswego, Oregon with his second wife, Risa Mora-Moreno. They have 
        been married since 2012 and have a daughter. Moreno was previously married to Celeste Schroeder from 1997 to 2006 with 
        whom he had two children.  
        Circa 1988, Moreno started jamming regularly with his high-school friends Abe Cunningham and 
        Stephen Carpenter, leading to the formation of Deftones. Within two years, the group started playing club shows. They 
        were signed to Maverick Records after one of their representatives saw them play in Los Angeles. Their first commercially 
        released album was Adrenaline (1995), produced by Terry Date. While the album wasn't an instant success, extensive touring, 
        word-of-mouth, and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fan base, as well as helping Adrenaline to sell over 
        220,000 copies without the singles "7 Words" and "Bored" (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay. For 1997's 
        Around the Fur, the band expanded its sound, spending more time with Date, and giving more thought to the album's 
        production. The record was highly anticipated and propelled Deftones to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength 
        of radio and MTV airplay for the singles "My Own Summer (Shove It)" and "Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)". (Wikipedia)
