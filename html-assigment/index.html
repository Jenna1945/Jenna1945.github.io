        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, this is my first semester at Algonquin 
            and I just graduated highschool last year.   
            So far college is going okay, although I don't 
            believe I am going to stay in this school for 
            much longer because I don't have plans to ever
            get a job in this field so I feel like I am here 
            for no reason.  Instead, I plan to get a job as 
            a flight attendant, or even work on a cruise 
            ship.  Both of these sound more appealing than 
            working as a media designer in my opinion.
        <p>Some other more personal things about me are that 
            my birthday is on April 7<sup>th</sup>, my favourite
            colour is <mark>yellow</mark> and my favourite musicians 
            are Björk, Lana Del Rey, and City Morgue.  My main hobby 
            includes music; I have a big collection of vinyls from 
            artists I like.  Since I enjoy music so much I'll include 
            2 of my favourite songs; <em>Xerces</em> by <strong>Deftones</strong>
            and <em>You Might Think He Loves You for Your Money but I Know What 
                He Really Loves You for It's Your Brand New Leopard Skin Pillbox 
                Hat</em> by <strong>Death Grips.</strong>
